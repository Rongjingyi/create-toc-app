In this version, toc.js adds a static version without a Node.js services. It called 'toc.serverless';  
So you can use add option '-s' to initial a serverless version;Like this

    create-toc-app -s <project name>
`

toc.serverless can create a simple React directory structure,And contains 'Ant desgin' and 'Lodash'.It even encapsulates 'Axios' as the request methods;All of this are configured.
